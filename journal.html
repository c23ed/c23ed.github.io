        <h3>Heart project</h3>
        <p>Today I finished my first codesketch. In this codesketch, there are a bunch of hearts spread out across the page and you have to guess how many there are. The challenge is that there are hearts that are hidden. Also, when you hover over the hearts, they expand.</p>

        <h3>Car in garage project</h3>
        <p>Over the course of this week, I have been working on completing my second code sketch. At first, I was going to do something relating to hitting a target with a ball. However, I was having difficulty finding out how to move the ball up to the target and found it easier to move an object from left to right. Because of this, I decided to change my project to moving a car into a garage (from left to right). The challenge for this code sketch is that the garage at first is too small for the car to reach; what you need to do is to first click on the garage to enlarge it. The only thing I need to do to finish this code sketch is to figue out a way to 'end' the code sketch when the car comes in contact with the garage.</p>

        <h3>Statistical Evidence vs. Implicit Bias</h3>
        <p>Something that suprised me about this podcast is the fact that they use algorithms to sentence people. One factor that is significantly more important than the rest in algorithims is age. That means that if you are 18-19, you have a much greater risk of being sentenced than if you are of an older age. I think there really is no ideal way to deal with legal systems; using humans means almost inevitable bias but so does using algorithms as seen by the fact that your age playes a big role in determining the likelihood that you committed a crime.</p>
